## Overview


## Setup

To create a python virtual environment run the following commands

```
virtualenv matrix
. ./matrix/bin/activate
```

Now any packages installed with pip will only impact this virtual environment and won't pollute your system installed Python


## Tests

Currently these can be run as follows


```
python/tests/<test filename>
```

I'll add a task runner later.
